# IMDB Movie Dashboard (Tableau)

This dashboard is the first one I created on my own. Before, I created dashboards by following tutorials and my own visualizations for the Back to Viz Basics community project.

My intention was to use the movie data to create a simple dashboard with very basic information about its variables. I set my focus more on the visual than the data part to get to know tableau better, especially its possibilities of using and formatting text, plots and colors.
